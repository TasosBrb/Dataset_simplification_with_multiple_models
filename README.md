Abstract

In the last decades, the complexity of data has been steadily increasing, often making some datasets highly complex. This problem becomes
even more acute in classification problems where the number of classes is quite large. In this scenario, we propose a different approach to
solving multi-class and multi-label classification problems using a "divide and conquer" technique, which uses N-1 different models for N number
of classes. The basic idea of the algorithm is for each of the N -1 models that are created, to use one less class from the original dataset until
only two classes remain in it. So its model will have an easier dataset and therefore will be able to achieve better results.
